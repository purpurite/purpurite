## The Colorscheme

> The colorscheme is a large list of colors that the palettes use.

moonlitPurple's colorscheme is based on HSB. Each hue has the same saturation, with different shades of brightness. 

Each Hue, Saturation, and Brightness value is a multiple of `20`.

Each color in the colorscheme has many shades with the same hue and saturation but a different brightness.

For example, `purple6` is one shade darker (20 Lower in Brightness) than `purple5`, `purple4` is one shade lighter (20 Higher in Brightness) than `purple5`. `purple3` is one shade lighter than `purple4`, and so on.
